###======== STANDARD PARAMETERS ========###

# The filter accepts an arbitrary number of inputs from each input message type (Odometry, PoseStamped,
# TwistStamped, Imu). To add a new one, simply append the next number in the sequence to its base name,
# e.g., odom0, odom1, twist0, twist1, imu0, imu1, imu2, etc. The value should be the topic name. These
# parameters obviously have no default values, and must be specified.
odom0: /segway/odometry/gps
odom1: /segway/odometry/local_filtered


# Each sensor reading updates some or all of the filter's state. These options give you greater control over
# which values from each measurement are fed to the filter. For example, if you have an odometry message as input,
# but only want to use its Z position value, then set the entire vector to false, except for the third entry.
# The order of the values is x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. Note that not some
# message types lack certain variables. For example, a TwistWithCovarianceStamped message has no pose information, so
# the first six values would be meaningless in that case. Each vector defaults to all false if unspecified, effectively
# making this parameter required for each sensor.
odom0_config:   [true,  true, false, 
                 false, false, false, 
                 false, false, false, 
                 false, false, false,
                 false, false, false]

odom1_config:   [false, false,  false, 
                 true,  true,  false, 
                 false, false, false, 
                 true,  true,  true,
                 false, false, false]

# The best practice for including new sensors in robot_localization's state estimation nodes is to pass in velocity 
# measurements and let the nodoes integrate them. However, this isn't always feasible, and so the state estimation
# nodes support fusion of absolute measurements. If you have more than one sensor providing absolute measurements, 
# however, you will quickly run into problems, as the sensors will inevitably diverge from one another, causing the 
# filter to jump back and forth rapidly. To combat this situation, you can set the sensor's differential parameter 
# to true. This will carry out differential integration of the sensor data, i.e., it will repeatedly integrate the 
# difference between a given measurement and the previous measurement from that sensor. 
# NOTE: this only applies to sensors that provide absolute measurements, so Twist messages are not supported.
odom1_differential: true


###======== ADVANCED PARAMETERS ========###

# By default, the subscription queue size for each message type is 1. If you wish to increase that so as not
# miss any messages (even if your frequency is set to a relatively small value), increase these.
odom0_queue_size: 10
odom1_queue_size: 10

# If your data is subject to outliers, use these threshold settings, expressed as Mahalanobis distances, to control
# how far away from the current vehicle state a sensor measurement is permitted to be. Each defaults to
# numeric_limits<double>::max() if unspecified.
#odom0_pose_rejection_threshold:  5
#odom0_twist_rejection_threshold: 1
